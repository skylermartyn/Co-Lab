It's hard starting out in any field. How do you get the experience? The
answer is, emphatically, make something! Start a project!

The division of labor that goes into making an application, however, proves
to be quite a roadblock in actualizing a goal. In order to complete certain
aspects of a project, you need the help of other people in the field. But if
you're just starting out it's likely you don't know anyone in the field, and 
all at once the idea that had so much promise seems so impossible.

For any project you can think of, there are people who can help make that 
happen. And likely they're people like you. People looking for something to
pour their creativity into. A diamond in the rough ready to be refined.

This is a platform for technologists to find each other and collaborate on
their projects and more efficiently create products for market or portfolios.
